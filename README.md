My personal website, hosted on github!

This website was made for a school project, I will keep it lying around because there is some interesting javascript at work here. I utilized 
the ocanvas library to create a interactive "bubble" experience. It should work for different images. I am aware however that when the canvas
changes size, the graphics get a bit messed up. I don't believe I threw any event listening for that in sadly. Enjoy my academic writing too however!
All of the things I say are backed by references woohoo!
