        <p>
            The 1805 portrait of Henry Knox, painted by Gilbert Stuart, that hangs in the Museum of Fine Arts Boston pictures only half of the man Henry Knox was. It neglects to show the other half of the Knox who as a boy, once roamed the streets of Boston as a
            notorious street fighter.<a class="ref" name="catref" href="#cat">1</a> The painting, made in Boston 1805, is no more than streaks and dabs of oil paint, and yet it is so much more than the sum of it’s parts.<a class="ref" href="#dog"
            name="dogref">2</a> It is a painting that brings life to Knox, as the great Gilbert Stuart so often did, it humanizes him, and brings many closer to the man who was a great American hero. It speaks the tales of the man portrayed, including
            his famous cannon-dragging campaign from Ticonderoga that took place in the winter of 1775-1776<a class="ref" href="#dollar" name="dollarref">3</a>. The painting shows a man who overcame many obstacles, and many hurdles in his lifetime. Yet
            the man in the painting does not show a shred of weakness or scarring in his eyes. The portrait shows us a man significant to the revolution that took place in colonial America in the late eighteenth century, a man who helped shape the United
            States today through the victories he helped to win with victories in Boston, in March 1776, and in the battle of Long Island, New York in August 1776. <a class="ref" href="#phone" name="phoneref">4</a>  <a class="ref" href="#car" name="carref">5</a> Henry
            Knox’s portrait includes and neglects many important details about him such as his personal upbringing, his personality, his private life, what he did in his position in the army, and how he got there.

            The 122 by 98 centimeter portrait, made in 1805 Boston, of Henry Knox is just another timeless portrait for Gilbert Stuart, a mere business venture for him, although to many Americans it is much more.<a class="ref" href="#metal" name="metalref">6</a> As
            Gilbert Stuart so famously does, the painting captures the essence of Henry Knox in paint for all to witness and see for themselves. As Boston poet Sarah Morton put it about Gilbert Stuart’s works “Tis character that breathes,” in his paintings,
            and “tis soul that twines / Round the rich canvas, trac’d in living lines.”<a class="ref" href="#fire" name="fireref">7</a> Henry Knox’s sitting for Gilbert Stuart would have been quite the event, as he was known at the time for the way with
            which he entertained those who sat for him for their portraits.<a class="ref" href="#grass" name="grassref">8</a> At the time Gilbert Stuart was considered one of the best painters of the world. The price of his paintings were around $100 at
            the time, which would equate to around $1553.54 in today’s market, this amount of money often took a long time to be converted into an actual painting, as Gilbert Stuart was notorious for not finishing paintings in a timely manner.<a class="ref" href="#water" name="waterref">9</a> One account
            described Stewart’s workshop as a place where portrait the likes of John Quincy Adams, Lady Adams, Bishop Griswold, and the likes laying around unfinished in his workshop.<a class="ref" href="#fire" name="fireref">10</a> This particular portrait features Henry Knox in his colonel garb, hand
            on cannon, and staring towards the viewers. It is a rather traditional portrait by Stuart, not the type of experimental painting that put him on the map with works like <i>The Skater</i> back when he was an aspiring artist in England.<a class="ref" href="#ice" name="iceref">11</a> The painting,
            however, provides a short glimpse of the man who was Henry Knox. As a man who lived before the age of photographs, this is the very closest we will perhaps get to the likeness of this famous general. Gilbert Stuart’s painting, like his paintings
            of Washington, allow us to look closer and see the men who formed our nation’s past.

        <p>
            Henry Knox in this portrait rests his hand upon a cannon on his left side. This cannon represents not only Henry Knox’s position of commanding the artillery of the continental army, but of the trek that Henry Knox is famous for, the journey in which Henry Knox retrieved, and brought back with him cannons from Fort Ticonderoga in New York. Fort Ticonderoga had been previously captured by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold three weeks after the battles at Lexington and Concord with a small band of men on May 10, 1775.<a class="ref" href="#paper" name="paperref">12</a> At Fort Ticonderoga lay well-needed military supplies, 78 cannons, 3 howitzers, and 6 mortars.<a class="ref" href="#slime" name="slimeref">13</a> The journey to Fort Ticonderoga was authorized by the Congress on October 23, however it was much less easily done as Fort Ticonderoga laid more than 300 miles away.<a class="ref" href="#fireball" name="fireballref">14</a> The roads were rough and success was not certain. To drag these cannons, Knox had to use large oxen, even paying locals for the use of their farm animals.<a class="ref" href="#journal" name="journalref">15</a> When Knox finally arrived at the fort, he ordered men to put the cannons upon boats and have them cross over to the northern tip of Lake George.<a class="ref" href="#like" name="likeref">16</a> The crossing did not fare well for him. On January 4th, 1776 “the heaviest cannon had fallen into the river”.<a class="ref" href="#dwarf" name="dwarfref">17</a> Even worse the river was especially treacherous during the crossing as both the river ice and the snow were melting as the trek across the ice was being made, making the ice brittle and now the snow-missing ground unfit for the transport of guns.<a class="ref" href="#axe" name="axeref">18</a> In addition to weather conditions, Knox found it hard to keep his men going. At one point in the journey in which the team had to make the steep ascent of a mountain, the teams of men dragging the cannon along stopped, and were unwilling to continue. Knox had to persuade them, for about three hours, stoking the flame of patriotism and hate for the British, before the team was finally moving again.<a class="ref" href="#elf" name="elfref">19</a> And the mountains were no easy feat for Knox’s men. “We might almost have seen all the Kingdoms of the Earth”, remarked Knox in his journal while on the mountain, commenting on the height of the landform he was crossing.<a class="ref" href="#wiz" name="wizref">20</a> But the journey was not in vain. The journey was well worth it for the army, and soon General Washington and Henry Knox launched an attack on Boston from Dorchester Heights using the newly acquired fire power resulting the evacuation of the British. Gilbert Stuart made sure that this famous journey did not go unrealized in his portrait of Knox, and that is why he included it on the right side of the painting.

            </figure>
            In addition to the cannon that Henry Knox rests his hand upon, there are other hidden components in this famous portrait. Henry Knox’s generous girth, that the painter, Gilbert Stuart attributes to him, is no mistake or biased account of the man. Henry Knox was a large man in his time. It was not always so, when he was a young man, he was known to be athletic and to have a good physique. As he got older, however he began to grow horizontally. When he married he continued to grow, as Mark Puls puts it politely in his <i>Henry Knox: Visionary General of the American Revolution</i> married life began to agree with him”.<a class="ref" href="#kid" name="kidref">21</a> Despite an ongoing boycott in Boston for British goods, Henry Knox grew to be around a <u>hefty 260 pounds</u>.<a class="ref" href="#bop" name="bopref">22</a> In addition to Henry Knox’s bountiful waist, in this portrait, Henry Knox’s left hand which he is laying on the cannon is curled. This is clever guise by Gilbert Stuart to hide Henry Knox’s missing pinkie and ring finger. He lost these fingers on a fishing trip. His shotgun, without warning, accidentally fired into his hand, tragically shooting right through his fingers. After the incident he was extremely saddened at this mishap, as this one instance of misfortune had cost him something that would affect him for the rest of his life.<a class="ref" href="#red" name="redref">23</a> He spent his birthday, July 25th, tending to his new wound. Following the accident he was ashamed and horrified at his mistake, often hiding his missing fingers with handkerchiefs, he would continue to do this throughout the rest of his time on earth.<a class="ref" href="#fur" name="furref">24</a> Gilbert Stuart craftily includes these details in his portrait, providing an honest and true account of the man who sat in front of him.
        </p>
        <h2 id="p:upbringing" class="title">His Childhood</h2>
        <p>
            Henry Knox’s early life, unrepresented in his portrait, was filled with hardship, and hard work. Henry Knox was born on July 25, 1750 in Boston, Massachusetts.<a class="ref" href="#kill" name="killref">25</a> His parents realized early on that he was intelligent, so they applied him for the Boston Latin Grammar School, a prestigious school run by Master John Lovell. He was accepted. This would have been a crowning achievement for him and his parents, as among the alumni of the Boston Latin Grammar School were names such as <b>Samuel Adams</b> and <b>Benjamin Franklin</b>.<a class="ref" href="#ball" name="ballref">26</a> However, his father began facing hard times as his shipbuilding business collapsed.<a class="ref" href="#green" name="greenref">27</a> He had a lot of debt, and so he left behind his family without a trace leaving on a ship bound for the West Indies. His family had no means to support themselves financially and so Henry Knox was left all alone to support his three year old brother and his mother receiving no help from his older brothers who had left home early to pursue being merchant seamen. So, Henry Knox was forced to drop out of his school to support the family.

                <img src="img/books.jpg" width="100%">
            </figure>
            Wharton and Bows Messr, owners of bookstore soon took pity on little Knox and hired him to work in their shop, as to lessen the burden that he bore.
            Henry Knox began to read in the shop in his idle time, reading literature such as Plutarch’s Lives of Ancient Greek and Roman Leaders. He enjoyed reading about ancient battles and the stories behind their characters. With his knowledge from his latin school, Knox was even able to teach himself to read and become close-to fluent in French. He read philosophy, about war leaders, and classic stories becoming knowledgeable along the way, something that would become important on his road to becoming colonel. Eventually, tidings of Knox’s father’s death reached Boston. His father had died in the West Indies at the mere age of 50. Henry Knox was devastated. His emotions were conflicting, and he struggled with feelings of abandonment. These feelings eventually brought Henry Knox to the streets. He found friends in the hard juvenile gangs of Boston. He became good at fighting, which allowed him to emotionally express his frustrations.<a class="ref" href="#you" name="youref">28</a> He became known for his brawling in fact, becoming the crowned champion of his neighborhood in Boston. He fought many of the leaders of other gangs in Boston too, and bested many of them. He was considered the <b>best fighter</b> in his area in Boston for at least 3 years. One occasion, called “Pope’s night” Henry Knox showed the community his brute strength. Pope’s Night was a tradition in the Boston streets that on November 5th, rival gangs would march to Union street bearing effigies of the pope and devil (an anti-catholic gesture). As they would walk to Union street, they would be commanding coins from those who past them and the homeowners. The goal of the event was to capture each other's effigy for dominance.<a class="ref" href="#pope" name="poperef">29</a> Knox’s gang had placed their effigy on a cart, when all of a sudden the cart lost one of it’s wheel. Henry Knox however, was persistent enough to slide his shoulder underneath the cart, and drag the cart along, bearing the weight so that his gang could continue their march. Many people were impressed. On the over front although champion of the streets, Henry Knox was also champion of the bookstore. He had come to prosper in the store, overnight turning back into the intelligent boy that everyone had come to love. <b>Samuel Adams</b>, a frequenter of the store, thought of Knox as a “young gentleman of very good reputation”.<a class="ref" href="#glass" name="glassref">30</a> Henry Knox was a conflicting character, being both an intelligent prodigy and a gang member at the same time. His upbringing was the perfect environment for creating a general, a leader of the people, who had the courage and ferocity of a fighter but also the intellect of a tactician such as Caesar. This story of hardship goes unnoticed unfortunately in Stuart’s portrait of Knox, but it is no less important than what Stuart included. His upbringing crafted, and molded the leader that is portrayed in the painting.

                <figcaption>Henry Knox made fortifications at the Battle of Bunker Hill.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            Considering Henry Knox’s personal upbringing and struggle, he was bound for greatness, which he <b>did</b> achieve in the form as colonel of artillery corps of the continental army, a position that is represented reflected in his portrait through the uniform he is outfitted with. Henry Knox’s journey all began when he saw a military parade. He was so impressed with the artillery company’s performance in the parade that he decided he wanted to join the ranks.<a class="ref" href="#star" name="starref">31</a> The company was named the Boston Grenadier Corps.<a class="ref" href="#gosh" name="goshref">32</a> He began drilling under Paddock, the leader, and he quickly learned how to operate a cannon correctly. What he began to realize was that using artillery wasn’t just about firing a cannon, there was a lot of underlying science to it all. So Henry Knox went back to the bookstore and began to learn how to build entrenchments and fortifications. He learned calculus which was needed in order to accurately fire the artillery. To do all these things he began to borrow books from the Harvard library. He learned the biographies of famous generals, even reading Julius Caesar’s commentaries on war. He taught himself the best way to transport cannons that weighed several tons, and how to look at a position geographically and understand it’s strengths and weaknesses.<a class="ref" href="#nice" name="niceref">33</a> Soon he became leader of his own brigade. Knox, eventually, decided to join the war and walked to encampment of patriots in Cambridge, called the “camp of liberty”. He was appalled at what he saw. He saw chaos: the soldiers were mere unemployed seamen, hunters, and farmers. He marched to the tent of the commander of the encampment, Artemas Ward, and joined the army. The commander was delighted, for Knox was one of the only men in the camp with military engineering knowledge. Ward wanted to give him a specific commission, but Knox refused and suggested to Ward that he would be more useful in improving the designs of the fortifications throughout the army.
            <a class="ref" href="#man" name="manref">34</a>
            And so, Henry Knox, after so famously dragging the cannons from Ticonderoga all the way back to Boston, made fortifications at Roxbury. These fortifications though useful, were not good enough later in the Battle of Bunker hill in which British fire forced the patriots to retreat. But all was not a loss. General Washington met Henry Knox as he was walking an errand to Cambridge and Washington was well impressed by Henry Knox’s designs at Roxbury.<a class="ref" href="#roxbury" name="roxburyref">35</a> Washington from there on out took a liking to Knox later placing him as colonel to lead the continental army’s artillery, replacing Colonel Richard Gridley. Colonel Richard Gridley was replaced by Knox because of how much more young Knox was, and how leaders like Washington disliked his manner.<a class="ref" href="#manner" name="mannerref">36</a> Without ever serving as a private in the army, Knox was officially promoted by Congress to the rank of colonel. The rest is history. The story of Henry Knox’s rise to colonel isn’t represented in Gilbert Stuart’s painting, but the result of the journey is.

        </figure>
        <p>
            Henry Knox as colonel of the continental army’s artillery had many military exploits that are not limited to his journey to and from Ticonderoga. Henry Knox was a major part of the liberation of Boston. On March 2, 1776 Knox began his assault on Boston, and on Monday evening March 4, Knox oversaw the mounting of his cannons on Dorchester Heights. The position was crucial for it’s ability to fire upon the British ships that floated in the harbor was of great importance. His cannonade was so successful that on March 17, on St. Patrick’s Day, the British evacuated their 8900 soldiers and 1100 loyalists onto 78 ships and flee Boston for Nova Scotia.<a class="ref" href="#scotia" name="scotiaref">37</a> Knox was also a big part of Washington's famous Delaware crossing. His role was to oversee the crossing of main part of the army and to bring across, carefully, the cannons that would prove useful in the Battle of Long Island in August 1776.<a class="ref" href="#ny" name="nyref">38</a> His cannons proved to be the finishing blow for the Hessians stationed in Trenton, New Jersey. The battle was won when Henry Knox lined up his mobile artillery at the head of the street a mere 300 yards away from the opposing soldiers. The cannonballs ripped through their lines, sending them scattering. After the battle, Knox and Washington were able to report that although 23 of their officers were dead, 886 of the Hessians were taken prisoner, and 1200 guns were obtained in the process.<a class="ref" href="#process" name="processref">39</a> Henry Knox also had a hand in the last battle of the Revolutionary war in Yorktown, Virginia in the month of October 1781. With amazing accuracy, Knox’s artillery was able to pin the British on the Yorktown peninsula, and after 8 days of a Knox headed assault, General Cornwallis of the British surrendered, and the revolutionary war was over.<a class="ref" href="#surrender" name="surrenderref">40</a> For Knox’s contributions he was awarded the second star, thus making Henry Knox, 31 at the time, the youngest major general in the army.<a class="ref" href="#young" name="youngref">41</a> A prestige that went unnoticed in his portrait, but is nevertheless significant and important.
        </p>
        <h2 id="p:influence" class="title">Influence on Today</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond being the general of the artillery for the continental army, Knox made many contributions to the war and what would become the underlying history of America.<a class="ref" href="#war" name="warref">42</a> Without Knox’s journey to fetch the big guns from Ticonderoga, history would have soon gone in favor of the British. The first revolutionary victory that Washington claimed of Boston was in large favor to Henry Knox. And the victory in Boston was instrumental. Being the first battle that went to the colonists Knox gave the colonists the exact kick they needed, he gave pride to the Americans won over those who had been questioning joining the war for independence.<a class="ref" href="#kick" name="kickref">43</a> With Knox’s help, Washington was able to win many more battles, and finally earn independence for America. Beyond his military exploits, Henry Knox can also be attributed for the creation and operation of the foundry in Springfield, Massachusetts for the United States Arsenal. He made the arrangements needed for an air furnace to be built there. This foundry became well used by the United States in the wars they soon fought as a new country. It produced many technological advances to weaponry including, but not limited to the Springfield rifles, named after the foundry they were from, that helped decide the fate of the Civil War. The foundry that Henry Knox helped create only went out of operation in 1968.<a class="ref" href="#foundry" name="foundryref">44</a> In addition, Henry Knox also helped in influencing the Congress’ decision to establish military academies, military colleges, to educate young recruits in the art of war and help establish the needed sciences that would be needed once the independent United States was made.<a class="ref" href="#last" name="lastref">45</a> Henry Knox not only helped decide the fate of the Revolutionary War with his actions, influencing every battle in which he participated in, but he also helped shape the America we have today, helping Congress realize the importance of creating military institutions for the education of soldier and helping create the Springfield Armory that influenced many wars that the United States of America would later fight as a country separate from England.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title" id="p:conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Gilbert Stuart’s portrait of Henry Knox that hangs in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts recognizes and forgets many parts of the legacy of Henry Knox, such as his upbringing, his role in the history of the United States of America, his private life outside war, and most importantly his significance to America today. Gilbert Stuart’s portrait neglects to show the journey Knox made to his military position as colonel of the artillery corps for the continental army. But it does showcase his famous Ticonderoga journey in the army, with his hand resting on the cannon. The portrait also has many factual accuracies, like Henry Knox’s large size and his tendencies to hide his missing fingers. It neglects to show Americans what Knox did past dragging cannons from the Fort in New York, including major battles in New Jersey, and the liberation of Boston. In conclusion, Gilbert Stuart captured Henry Knox for history, becoming part of the ever growing American culture, which was born on the creation of the United States. It gave people of that time period the ability to have pride, and the ability to visualize their culture. The portrait allowed them to for the first time ever, have their own history and culture as a new nation, much like all of Gilbert Stuart’s paintings of the time, namely of Washington. But even more importantly, the portrait of Henry Knox today provides a window to the past for 21st century citizens to see the man that affected their world to a major degree. It provides a captured moment of time, that would be otherwise impossible because of the lack of photo technology at the time. It gives us modern viewers the ability to visualize our past, and make more human the man who was Henry Knox.
